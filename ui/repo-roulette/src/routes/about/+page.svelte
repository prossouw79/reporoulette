		Repo roulette is a fun unprepared code review generator. You can enter your email address on the
		homepage and fetch a random set of git repositories you've committed to in Bitbucket.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you spin the repository wheel to select a random repository, you'll see random commits of
		yours from that repository on the commit wheel.
